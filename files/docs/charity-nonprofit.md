# Nonprofit / Charity

You are a nonprofit organisation in need of Salesforce support. Look no further than The Technical Collective!

We are a team of passionate volunteers, here to support charities in their journey towards leveraging the power of Salesforce. We understand that time and budget constraints can make it challenging for nonprofits to hire additional resources to support their teams to satisfy all their organisational requirements. 

That's where we come in. We connect enthusiastic junior Salesforce professionals who are seeking work experience with charities in need of support. Our goal is to match the right professional with the right organisation, ensuring a mutually beneficial partnership. By volunteering their time and expertise, our professionals help charities optimize their Salesforce systems, provide strategic guidance, and empower them to achieve their mission with the support of technical experts. At The Technical Collective, we believe in the power of collaboration and making a positive impact. Let us be your partner in harnessing the full potential of Salesforce for your charity.
