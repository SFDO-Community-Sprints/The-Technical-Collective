# Promises & Expectations

## Promises & expectations between the Nonprofits & Technical Experts

**Nonprofits:**
Our mission is very important to us. In order for us to create change and make an impact for this cause we care deeply about, we need real time information to see how successful our initiatives are.

We understand that we are fully responsible and accountable for our org, and that the junior Salesforce professional will help us do the work (with the guidance of the technical experts) that we need to achieve the aims of our charity.
When things go wrong, we will collectively work to create an action plan to move forward, and we will also learn from the experience so that we can avoid similar mistakes in future.

**We promise to:**
* Have strong leadership representation who will listen to technical advice
* Make time to have thoughtful discussions, respond to queries and review documents where necessary
* Respect the time that our technical experts are providing and considering options carefully
* We will make decisions based on discussions and recommendations
* Show our appreciation to the Salesforce team by providing personal written testimonials, recommendations and referrals

**Technical Expert**

We care deeply about implementing Salesforce correctly in organisations, and we understand that charities and nonprofits sometimes do not have technical capability internally to leverage the platform and utilise the functionalities.

We aim to share our collective technical experience in order to guide the charities to shape their long term strategy around Salesforce and to build internal capabilities to support their mission.

In aid of this, we promise to utilise our collective skills and experience to:

* Understand charity mission, current technical and business landscape, and run discovery to help gain clarity on their long term goals
* Use Salesforce Well-Architected framework to build solutions that provide long term value for the charity
* Provide strategic advice on technical implementation of Salesforce and related clouds/apps
* Advice on the technical and project governance to ensure the projects are successful
* Guide the charity on how to build their internal capability by reviewing the job descriptions for the admin job role and general advice on candidate recruitment process
* Be clear about the hours and timings that we can commit to the programme
Be honest if we are no longer able to provide services due to personal or professional circumstances
