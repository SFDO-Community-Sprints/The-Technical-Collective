# The Technical Collective

## Who we are  

The Technical Collective solves a familiar three-way problem in the Salesforce ecosystem:

* **Junior admins** need real-world experience to land their first role.  
* **Non-profits & charities** have 10 free Salesforce licences but often lack hands-on help.  
* **Technical experts** want to volunteer, yet need a framework that makes their time effective.

Formed at the **Salesforce Commons sprint (January 2023)**, our programme puts all three groups into a single, mentored project pipeline.
