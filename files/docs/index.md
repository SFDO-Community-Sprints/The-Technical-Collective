# Overview

## What is The Technical Collective?

This project was born from an age-old problem in the Salesforce ecosystem:

* **Junior admins** lack the work experience to land their first job role.  
* **Non-profits & charities** receive donated Salesforce licences but need help to start or maintain their systems.  
* **Technical experts** want to volunteer, yet lack a structured way to make their time effective.

At the **Salesforce Commons sprint (January 2023)** a group of us designed a programme that **upskills junior admins** while **helping non-profits** get the most from Salesforce—supported by a pool of seasoned professionals.
