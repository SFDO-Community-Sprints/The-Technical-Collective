# What is The Technical Collective?

This project was born from an age-old problem in the Salesforce ecosystem. **Junior admins** don’t have enough work experience to land their first job role. **Nonprofits and charities** have donated Salesforce licenses, but need help either getting started or maintaining their systems. **Technical experts** want to support, but don’t have the structure to volunteer their time properly.

A group of us got together at the *Salesforce Community Sprint* in January 2023, and put together a program to upskill inexperienced admins who could help nonprofits make the most of the Salesforce platform with the added support of a group of experienced Salesforce professionals.

# Who can participate?

## **Nonprofits & Charities** 
> Nonprofit organisations can benefit from either pro-bono or compensated support on a scoped piece of Salesforce project work. We know that nonprofit organisations are often short on resources and can benefit from additional support: whether it is an update to the existing processes, creating some reports & dashboards, or helping to document the system. The nonprofits supported will be small- to mid-sized organizations leveraging donated Salesforce licenses through the [Power of Us Program](https://www.salesforce.com/company/power-of-us/).

## **Junior Salesforce Professionals**
> Junior Salesforce professionals will be individuals who have already upskilled in Salesforce by earning at least one certification, but are seeking work experience to add to their CV or resume.
