# Who we are

## What is The Technical Collective?

This project was born from the age‑old problem in the Salesforce ecosystem:

* **Junior admins** don’t have enough work experience to land their first job role.  
* **Non‑profits and charities** have free Salesforce licenses, but need help getting started or keeping their systems running.  
* **Technical experts** want to volunteer, but lack a structure that makes their time effective.

In January 2023, at a Salesforce Commons sprint, a group of us designed a programme that:

* Upskills inexperienced admins  
* Helps charities make the most of Salesforce  
* Provides support and mentoring from seasoned Salesforce professionals

## The groups involved

### Non‑profits

Small‑ to mid‑sized organisations using the **10 free Salesforce licences** can apply for either pro‑bono or compensated help on a clearly scoped piece of work—anything from refining processes, building reports & dashboards, to documenting the system.

### Junior Salesforce Professionals

People who have earned **at least one Salesforce certification** and want real‑world experience to strengthen their CVs.

### Technical Experts

A pool of volunteers with **5+ years in the Salesforce ecosystem**—including MVPs, Champions and other seasoned professionals—who guide and quality‑check every engagement.
